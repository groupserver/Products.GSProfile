        The user that you were trying to log in as was not found.
        Please check the link you followed, as it may be broken over two
        lines.
        If the link is broken, fix it by pasting both parts into the 
        location-bar (also known as the <q>address</q> bar) 
        of your Web browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the link is not broken, it may have expired. (Links to set your
        password are valid for one click only.) Please visit the 
        <a href="/reset_password.html">Reset Password</a> page to request 
        a new password. When you receive the new link, please ensure that 
        you click on it only once.
