= GroupServer Form UI Guide =

- Titles -
  
  The title of the page, and the primary heading on the page, will be 
  written in the form Verb Noun (action object). For example
    * Reset Password
    * Add Friend
    * Play Thermonuclear War

  
- Elements -
  
  All elements should have an associated label. The label should be a noun:
    * Email Address
    * Message
    * Biography 

  
- Buttons -

  The primary, or only, button for a form shall be labelled with a verb. 
  The button label should be taken from the title of the page:
    * Reset
    * Add
    * Play
  If there is a secondary button, it shall also be labelled with a verb,
  with the accompanying help text giving further information, such as a
  "Preview" button.

  All buttons shall be placed at the bottom of the form.

  There shall never be a button for clearing (resetting) the form. See
  Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox article
    http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000416.html


- Help Text - 
  
  Help text should be provided for the entire form, and each form element.
  
  The help text for the form should state
    * The purpose of the form,
    * What will be disclosed (if anything), and
    * What will happen when the form is submitted.
  When a button is referred to in the help text, it should be referred to
  as “the <samp class="button">verb</samp> button”. A link is referred to
  by just the link-text.
  
  All form elements should have some help text. This text should describe 
  how the element fits into the wider context of the system.


- Error Messages -

  Error messages must state:
    * What happened, and
    * What the user should do about it.
  See the guidelines for the GNOME Error Alerts:
