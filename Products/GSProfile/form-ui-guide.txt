= GroupServer Form UI Guide =

- Titles -
  
  The title of the page, and the primary heading on the page, will be 
  written in the form Verb Noun (action object). For example
    * Reset Password
    * Add Friend
    * Play Thermonuclear War

  
- Elements -
  
  All elements should have an associated label. The label should be a noun:
    * Email Address
    * Message
    * Biography
    
  The label for a required element should start with an asterisk, and the
  form-widget division element should use the "register" class. If there is
  only one form element on the page, then it is not necessary to mark it as
  required.

  
- Buttons -

  The primary, or only, button for a form shall be labelled with a verb. 
  The button label should be taken from the title of the page:
    * Reset
    * Add
    * Play
  If there is a secondary button, it shall also be labelled with a verb,
  with the accompanying help text giving further information, such as a
  "Preview" button.

  All buttons shall be placed at the bottom of the form.

  There shall never be a button for clearing (resetting) the form. See
  Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox article
    http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000416.html


- Help Text - 
  
  Help text should be provided for the entire form, and each form element.
  
  The help text for the form should state
    * Why it is necessary to fill out the form,
    * How to fill out the form, and
    * What will happen when the form is submitted.
  If private information is disclosed after the form is submitted, this
  must be stated.
    
  When a button is referred to in the help text, it must be referred to as
  “the <samp class="button">verb</samp> button”. A link is referred to by
  just the link-text.
  
  Individual elements should have some help text. This text should describe 
  how the element fits into the wider context of the system. The help text
  may be presented as the element title, if it is short, or with JavaScript
  popups, if the text is longer.


- Error Messages -

  Error messages must state:
    * What happened, and
    * What the user should do about it.
  See the guidelines for the GNOME Error Alerts:
